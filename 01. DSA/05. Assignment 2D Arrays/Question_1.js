//Q.1 Convert 1D Array Into 2D Array

// You are given a **0-indexed** 1-dimensional (1D) integer array original, and two integers, m and n. You are tasked with creating a 2-dimensional (2D) array with Â m rows and n columns using **all** the elements from original.

// The elements from indices 0 to n - 1 (**inclusive**) of original should form the first row of the constructed 2D array, the elements from indices n to 2 * n - 1 (**inclusive**) should form the second row of the constructed 2D array, and so on.

// Return *an* m x n *2D array constructed according to the above procedure, or an empty 2D array if it is impossible*.

//Example 1:
//Input: original = [1,2,3,4], m = 2, n = 2

//Output: [[1,2],[3,4]]

//Explanation: The constructed 2D array should contain 2 rows and 2 columns.

// The first group of n=2 elements in original, [1,2], becomes the first row in the constructed 2D array.

// The second group of n=2 elements in original, [3,4], becomes the second row in the constructed 2D array.

//Solution
function convertTo2D(original, m, n) {
    if (original.length !== m * n) {
      return [];
    }
  
    const result = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      const row = [];
      for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        const index = i * n + j;
        row.push(original[index]);
      }
      result.push(row);
    }
  
    return result;
  }

  //If we call the convertTo2D 

  const original = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const m = 2;
const n = 2;

const result = convertTo2D(original, m, n);
console.log(result); //output: [ [1,2],[3,4] ]

//Here  original 1D array [1, 2, 3, 4] is successfully converted into a 2D array with 2 rows and 2 columns as expected.
